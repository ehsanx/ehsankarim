Dr. M. Ehsan Karim is an Associate Professor in Health Data Science in the [School of Population and Public Health](http://www.spph.ubc.ca) at [The University of British Columbia](http://www.ubc.ca/), a Scientist at the [Centre for Advancing Health Outcomes](https://www.advancinghealth.ubc.ca/) (St. Paul’s Hospital), and an Associate Member of [UBC Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca). He was a [Michael Smith Health Research BC](https://healthresearchbc.ca/) Scholar (2018–2023).

He obtained his Ph.D. in Statistics from [UBC](http://hdl.handle.net/2429/51933), supported by a studentship from [MS Canada](https://mssociety.ca/). He completed his postgraduate training at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/) with a fellowship from the [Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (CNODES)](https://www.cnodes.ca/).

His research program focuses on developing and applying causal inference and data science methods to answer real-world comparative effectiveness questions using nonrandomized data. A central theme is the analysis of large health administrative databases, advancing state-of-the-art biostatistical and epidemiological methods to generate reliable real-world evidence. Multiple sclerosis is a key application area for his work. His research is supported by grants from [CIHR](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/), [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca), [MS Canada](https://mssociety.ca/), and the [BC SUPPORT Unit](https://bcsupportunit.ca/).

A dedicated educator and mentor, Dr. Karim supervises students in both [SPPH](http://www.spph.ubc.ca/) and [Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/people). He developed and teaches the PhD capstone course *SPPH 604*, and authored the open-access [*Advanced Epidemiological Methods*](https://ehsanx.github.io/EpiMethods/) textbook. He was named a [**UBC Open Educational Resources (OER) Champion**](https://champions.open.ubc.ca/) for 2024–2025.

Dr. Karim serves as an Associate Editor for *[Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10991557)* and is a regular grant reviewer for national funding bodies. His contributions have been recognized with the *Author Service Award* (*BMC Medical Research Methodology*, 2025), *Exemplary Reviewer* (*Epidemiology*, 2020), and *Best Reviewer* (*Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety*, 2015 & 2017).
