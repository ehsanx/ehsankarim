# In-class Teaching

## Graduate
- <u>UBC School of Population and Public Health</u>
  - **SPPH 504/007**: *Application of Epidemiological Methods* (Section 7: restricted to Ph.D. level students).
    - *General note about the expectation / requirement of the course*:
      - SPPH 504-007  is known to have a <u>heavy workload</u>, and a greater time commitment is expected. Based on students' background and comfortability with the quantitative subject materials covered in the course, they should make a judgment on how many other commitments they want to make during that term.
      - Strongly encourages students to have <u>fluency in R</u>. The time commitment can exponentially increase if the student is also trying to learn data wrangling with R at the same time.
    - **2021-2022** (upcoming term)
