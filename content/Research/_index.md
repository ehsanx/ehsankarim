# Causal Inference and Data Science Methods

See [publications](/publication/) page:

## Methodological Research: 

- [x] Practical issues dealing with large health administrative databases
  - Longitudinal studies: dealing with data sparseness in Marginal structural models
  - Incorporating proxy information via high-dimensional propensity score modelling and it's machine learning versions
  - Addressing unmeasured confounding via supplimentary information
- [x] Pragmatic trials: Incomplete Medication Adherence in Pragmatic trials
  - inverse probability of adherence weighting per-protocol effect in sustained treatment strategies
    - finite sample properties 
    - differential adherence
    - dealing with data sparseness for post-baseline prognostic factors
  - extending the principal stratification framework for multi-category of partial adherence
  - Comparing the per-protocol effect estimation methods with instrumental methods in point-treatment scenario
