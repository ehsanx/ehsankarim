# Causal Inference and Data Science Methods: fixing broken experiments!

My program of research is about developing causal inference methods for large healthcare data, with a particular emphasis on applications of data science tools. See [publications](/publication/) page for more details about each of the following:

## Methodological Research: 

- [x] **Use of machine learning / AI approaches in the causal inference context**
  - TMLE and variants
  - Double machine learning
  - Autoencoders for dimensionality reduction
- [x] **Practical issues dealing with large health administrative databases**
  - Longitudinal studies: dealing with data sparseness in Marginal structural models
  - Incorporating proxy information via high-dimensional propensity score modelling and it's machine learning versions
  - Addressing unmeasured confounding via supplimentary information
  - Time-dependent treatment and time-dependent confounding
    - Addressing immortal time bias in longitudinal studies   
  - Complex causal diagrams and respective analysis strategies
    - Mediation analysis: decomposing the effect of direct and indirect effects
  - Exposure misclassification in observational studies  
- [x] **Pragmatic trials**: Incomplete Medication Adherence in Pragmatic trials
  - Inverse probability of adherence weighting per-protocol effect in sustained treatment strategies
    - Finite sample properties 
    - Differential adherence
    - Dealing with data sparseness for post-baseline prognostic factors
  - Extending the principal stratification framework for multi-category of partial adherence
  - Comparing the per-protocol effect estimation methods with instrumental methods in point-treatment scenario

- [x] **Survey data analysis**
  - Incorporating causal inference and data science approaches within the survey data analysis framework
  - Motivating examples from DHS, NHANES, CCHS.
- [x] **Stepped-wedge Trial**
  - Sample size and power related practical issues when unequal clusters are present


## Real-World Applications 

- [x] **Impact in healthcare**
  - Multiple sclerosis
  - Tuberculosis
  - Arthritis
  - HIV
  - Opioid use disorder
  - Spinal cord
  - Cardiovascular risk
  - Mental health: depression and mood disorder
  - Pediatric intensive care
  - Nephrology and kidney disease
  - human papillomavirus vaccine
  - Child Hemoglobin
  - Antenatal care
  - Multimorbidity
  - Residential instability and hospitalizations among homeless and vulnerably housed individuals
- [x] **Impact in interdisciplinary research**
  - Forestry 
  - Nursing

## Building Capacity in Data Scienece and Causal Inference

- Proposing guidelines for propensity score analyses in disease specific areas
- See [teaching](/Teaching/) page for in-class teaching
- See [workshops](/workshops/) page for webinars, workshops
- [Supervision](/Supervision/) of graduate and undergraduate students / trainees.
