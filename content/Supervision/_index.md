| [Christopher Andrew Basham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/candrewbasham/), [SPPH](http://www.spph.ubc.ca/), Graduation expected 2021 | C. Andrew Basham is a tuberculosis (TB) epidemiologist with a background in Environmental and Urban Studies (BA) from the University of Winnipeg. Andrew has worked with First Nations in remote communities as a health policy analyst for Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak. In his MSc thesis in the University of Manitoba, Andrew investigated differences in TB program performance between First Nations (on and off-reserve), immigrants, and Canadian-born non-First Nations, discovering important population and geographic differences in program performance in the first application of quantitative performance measurement to a Canadian TB program. Andrew then worked for the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, where he developed an interest in health administrative data linkage and analysis. Under the supervision of Drs. Ehsan Karim and James Johnston, Andrew has completed his doctoral research on TB survivor health using causal inference methods with health administrative data. Methods used included high-dimensional propensity scoring, with hybrid machine learning, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), E-values for unmeasured confounding, and causal mediation analysis. Andrew has published extensively during his Ph.D. and is developing a new research interest in survivorship epidemiology. Andrew plans to develop a Partnership for Post-TB Health as a knowledge exchange and models of care development network. | ![](./images/ab.jpg) |
| [Md. Belal Hossain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/md-belal-hossain-3906b36a/), [SPPH](http://www.spph.ubc.ca/), transferred from MSc | Belal Hossain is a Ph.D. student at the School of Population and Public Health, University British Columbia. He is also working with Dr. Ehsan Karim as a Graduate Research Assistant at the School. Belal did his Bachelor’s and MSc degrees in Applied Statistics from the University of Dhaka. A recurring theme in his research is analyzing complex survey data collected through stratification and cluster sampling. He is motivated to develop and apply his skills within the public health realm through working experiences with various healthcare institutes in Bangladesh. Under Dr. Karim’s guidance, Belal has been working with causal inference methods to estimate treatment effects in trials with incomplete medication adherence, integrating machine learning approaches within the framework of causal inference, and applying/adapting these innovative and emerging techniques in real-life epidemiological data analysis. His current research interests include biostatistics and epidemiology, focusing on causal inference from observational studies and clinical trials with medication nonadherence, and machine learning and deep learning approaches in risk score prediction from a large healthcare database. | ![](./images/bh.jpg) |

| [Zishan (Michelle) Cui](http://linkedin.com/in/zishan-michelle-cui-97a3882b), [SPPH](http://www.spph.ubc.ca/) | Zishan (Michelle) Cui has a background in Statistics. Zishan completed her MSc in statistics at the University of British Columbia. Zishan has been working as a biostatistician in Providence Health Care, and has engaged in marginalized population research. Particularly, Zishan is interested in using machine learning methods to tackle substance use problems in British Columbia. Under the supervision of Dr. Ehsan Karim and Dr. Thomas Kerr, Zishan is working on her Ph.D. in the School of Population and Public Health in machine learning methods and poly-substance use research. Currently, Zishan is working at BC Centre on Substance Use and working collaboratively with BCCDC regarding BC Provincial Overdose Cohort.
