Andrew Basham is a tuberculosis (TB) epidemiologist with a background in Environmental and Urban Studies (BA) from the University of Winnipeg. Under the supervision of Drs. Ehsan Karim and James Johnston, Andrew has completed his doctoral research on TB survivor health using causal inference methods with health administrative data. He is currently a [research fellow](https://www.drugepi.org/dope/team) at the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital | ![](./images/ab.jpg) |
| [Md. Belal Hossain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/md-belal-hossain-3906b36a/), [SPPH](http://www.spph.ubc.ca/), transferred from MSc | Belal Hossain is a PhD candidate at the School of Population and Public Health, focusing on the association between tuberculosis (TB) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and developing risk prediction models using methods such as cohort studies, high-dimensional propensity scores (hdPS), high-dimensional disease risk scores (hdDRS), time-dependent Cox regression, and simulation studies. His research aims to improve the understanding of TB-related health risks and enhance predictive modeling in epidemiology.  | ![](./images/bh.jpg) |

Her research interests focus on the use of data science in health care, and she is currently working on developing a multiple sclerosis-specific comorbidity summary index ([MSCSI](https://mscanada.ca/ms-research/our-research-program/research-studies-we-fund/development-and-validation-of-an-ms)) to better understand and manage comorbid conditions in people with MS, using data from British Columbia, Manitoba, and Sweden. Her research seeks to identify key comorbidities affecting MS outcomes, test existing summary measures, and create a tailored comorbidity index to improve risk factor identification and clinical care for individuals with MS. | ![](./images/hf.jpg) |
| [Momenul Haque Mondol](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=hGgyIHUAAAAJ), [SPPH](http://www.spph.ubc.ca/), , transferred from MSc |  Momenul Haque Mondol is a PhD Candidate at the UBC School of Population and Public Health, jointly supervised by Dr. Ehsan Karim and [Prof. Bohdan Nosyk](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=kdatKR4AAAAJ&hl=en). His research aims to estimate the comparative effectiveness of different dose reversion strategies on treatment discontinuation among methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone users in British Columbia, Canada. By leveraging health administrative databases and employing a population-level retrospective cohort study, the study explores the impact of various interruption periods on the time to treatment discontinuation via emulated target trials. | ![](./images/mhm.jpg) |
