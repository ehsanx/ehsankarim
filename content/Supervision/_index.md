# Available to supervise

I am currently looking for a postdoctoral researchers and multiple graduate students (current and prospective) for a number of projects (with methodologic focuses within epidemiologic contexts). See [program of research](/Research/) for details about my research. Following are few examples:

- Improving Causal Inference Methods in Statistics for Analyzing [High-dimensional / Big Data](https://t.co/vvjmIrKMrR).
- Developing and Evaluating Causal Inference Methods for Pragmatic Trials to [address nonadherence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1etAewqHA).
- Applying causal inference methods within the context of the disease [multiple sclerosis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0962280216668554) in particular.

# Instructions to Apply

Graduate students in statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, economics or computer science with somewhat strong **methodological expertise in statistics** (as well as statistical computing) are encouraged to contact me directly; particularly those with some of the following skills: 

- making data requests, 
- extracting analytic data from administrative (e.g., health admin) and survey databases (e.g., DHS, NHANES, BRFSS or CCHS), 
- running statistical analyses using standard software (e.g., SAS, R or python), 
- coding statistical estimators (via SAS macro/IML, R, python or stata mata), 
- conducting simulation studies (e.g., in servers, parallel computing, High Performance Computing), 
- excellent scientific writing (e.g., demonstrated via peer-reviewed publications), 
- ability to work on a multidisciplinary team (e.g., work within biostatistics groups). 

Interested candidates should email me (at my UBC email address) the following: 

1. [x] a cover letter (2 pages max), mentioning 
  - whether you are interested in an MSc or a PhD program, or postdoctoral research?

  - research interests
  - degrees obtained
  - award list, if any, 
  - list presentation (seminar, conference, workshop) activities (*if any*)
  - list of research / work experiences / volunteering activities (*if any*)

    - in methodological research
    - in teaching 
    - in software publishing 
    - in leadership activities 
  - Names of 2 referees
    - with official email addresses.
3. [x] full publication record 
  - peer-reviewed published / accepted articles with full co-authors listed,
  - do not include in-progress or unsubmitted works
  - Send at most 2 sample articles of your choice where you are an author, and mention your contributions in each (*if any*)
4. [x] copy of the unofficial transcripts (post-secondary), and
