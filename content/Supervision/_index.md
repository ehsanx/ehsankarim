# Instructions to Apply

Graduate students in statistics, biostatistics, epidemiology, economics or computer science with somewhat strong **methodological expertise in statistics** (as well as statistical computing) are encouraged to contact me directly; particularly those with some of the following skills: 

- making data requests, 
- extracting analytic data from administrative (e.g., health admin) and survey databases (e.g., DHS, NHANES, BRFSS or CCHS), 
- running statistical analyses using standard software (e.g., SAS, R or python), 
- coding statistical estimators (via SAS macro/IML, R or stata mata), 
- conducting simulation studies (e.g., in servers / parallel computing), 
- excellent scientific writing (e.g., demonstrated via peer-reviewed publications), 
- ability to work on a multidisciplinary team (e.g., work within biostatistics groups). 

Interested candidates should email me (at my UBC email address) the following: 

- a cover letter, mentioning whether you are interested in an MSc or a PhD program, why you want to work with me,
- a complete CV (including award list, if any), 
- full publication record (peer-reviewed articles with full co-authors listed),
- copy of the unofficial transcripts (post-secondary), and 
- list of research / work experiences in healthcare related settings (if any)
- Names of 2 referees (with official email addresses).
- If you are coming from an institution where English is not used as the first language, please also include your TOEFL (iBT), IELTS or equivalent scores in your CV. Please check out these websites for [MSc](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/master-of-science-population-public-health) and [PhD](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/phd-population-public-health) requirements for SPPH, UBC (see under 'Requirements' section). Note that the requirements vary by department (e.g., check for [Statistics](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/graduate-degree-programs/master-of-science-statistics)).

Please check out my [G+PS profile](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/researcher/16712-karim) for my research interests, as well as my previous publications.

# Available to supervise

I am currently looking for multiple graduate students (current and prospective) for a number of projects (with methodologic focuses within epidemiologic contexts). Following are few examples:

- Improving Causal Inference Methods in Statistics for Analyzing [High-dimensional / Big Data](https://t.co/vvjmIrKMrR).
- Developing and Evaluating Causal Inference Methods for Pragmatic Trials to [address nonadherence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur1etAewqHA).
- Applying causal inference methods within the context of the disease [multiple sclerosis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0962280216668554) in particular.
