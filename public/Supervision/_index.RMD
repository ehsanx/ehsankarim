| [Christopher Andrew Basham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/candrewbasham/) ([SPPH](http://www.spph.ubc.ca/), Graduation expected 2021) | C. Andrew Basham is a tuberculosis (TB) epidemiologist with a background in Environmental and Urban Studies (BA) from the University of Winnipeg. Andrew worked for the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, where he developed an interest in health administrative data linkage and analysis. Under the supervision of Drs. Ehsan Karim and James Johnston, Andrew has completed his doctoral research on TB survivor health using causal inference methods with health administrative data. Methods used included high-dimensional propensity scoring, with hybrid machine learning, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), E-values for unmeasured confounding, and causal mediation analysis. | ![](./images/ab.jpg) |
| [Md. Belal Hossain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/md-belal-hossain-3906b36a/) ([SPPH](http://www.spph.ubc.ca/), transferred from MSc) | Belal Hossain is a Ph.D. student at the School of Population and Public Health, University British Columbia. Under Dr. Karim’s guidance, Belal has been working with causal inference methods to estimate treatment effects in trials with incomplete medication adherence, integrating machine learning approaches within the framework of causal inference, and applying/adapting these innovative and emerging techniques in real-life epidemiological data analysis. His current research interests include biostatistics and epidemiology, focusing on causal inference from observational studies and clinical trials with medication nonadherence, and machine learning and deep learning approaches in risk score prediction from a large healthcare database. | ![](./images/bh.jpg) |

She gained a background in mathematics, statistics, and computer science through the completion of a BSc in mathematical sciences at the University of British Columbia. Her research interests focus on the use of data science in health care, and she is currently working on a project looking at the use of machine learning in double robust methods in epidemiology. | ![](./images/hf.jpg) |

She is motivated by problems at the intersection of healthcare and data science, specifically ways to make health research more efficient. Under the supervision of Dr. Ehsan Karim, Lucy’s MSc. thesis compared causal inference methods to recover the true effect of receiving a new treatment when trial participants do not adhere to the treatment protocol. She has provided data management support to clinical trials and observational studies at Kingston General Hospital in the past. Currently, she is focused on methods to make better use of existing data through synthetic data generation to enable widespread data sharing at the start-up Replica Analytics. | ![](./images/lm.jpg) |
